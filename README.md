# Coding Challenge #2

## Challenge Description

In this coding challenge, you are tasked with using the BMI (Body Mass Index) example from Challenge #1 and enhancing it. Your goal is to print a clear and informative message to the console, indicating who has the higher BMI between Mark and John. The message should also include the exact BMI values for both individuals, presented using template literals.

## Tasks

1. Write JavaScript code to calculate the BMI for Mark and John.
2. Create a clear and nicely formatted output to the console that states who has the higher BMI. Use an if/else statement to determine the result.
3. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the output. The format should be something like this: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

## Hint

You can achieve this by comparing Mark's BMI with John's BMI using an if/else statement.
